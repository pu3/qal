------------------------------------

* Our inferences
- This absorber has been discussed to some detail by Lehner, along with PIE plots. So one has to see if there is anything more that can be done from the absorption line point of view.
- The HIRES data which shows Mg II is also discussed by Lehner et al.
- SDSS shows 7 galaxies within 1000 km/s and 10 Mpc. The nearest galaxy is within 1 Mpc. 

* From prior works:
logN(HI)=16.32±0.2 (Stevans et.al.)
b = 16 km/s (Stevans et.al.)
[X/H]=−0.40±0.05 (Lehner et.al.)
logU= −3.6±0.1 (Lehner et.al.)

- Lehner et al. Bimodal metallicity distribution of CGM paper has HI and metal line column densities and [X/H] for this.  Appendix has discusion on line measurements and modeling. Conclude no evidence for high ionization gas based on absence of O VI at this redshift. The absorber is single phase etc.
- Low ionziation PIE modeling yields [X/H] = -0.4 with [C/alpha] = -0.15  - from Lehner et al.
- Lehner et al. conclude that this absorber is enriched by Type II SNe.
- no galaxy reported. Galaxy information for their sample is taken by a large number of published works.  
- The HIRES data which shows Mg II is also discussed by Lehner et al.
- SDSS shows 7 galaxies within 1000 km/s and 10 Mpc. The nearest galaxy is within 1 Mpc. Lehner et al. conclude that this absorber is enriched by Type II SNe (from the relative abundance estimation).
- MUSE has 1 galaxy at 170 kpc.
