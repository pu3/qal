HE 1003+0149 / z = 0.41854
------------------------------------
* Alternate name for sightline - J100535.25+013445.5

* Our inferences
- Has H I in three distinct clouds. The central cloud is a pLLS.
- The pLLS has unsaturated metal lines to go with it.
- UVES data has Mg II doublets detected. The spectrum is of low S/N, but Mg II is clear and single component.
- No O VI is detected.
- SDSS shows two galaxies within 10 Mpc and 1000 km/s, but these galaxies are at 2 - 4 Mpc separation, hence unlikely to be tracing CGM of those galaxies.
- X shooter data is available 3000 A to 2.5 micron with spectral resolution of R ~ 7400. We are yet to check on whether the X-shooter data for this sightline is of use.

* From prior works:
log N(HI) =16.89 ± 0.04  (CCC I, CCC II,N. Tejos et al.(2018))
[X/H] = −1.08 ± 0.06 (CCC I, CCC II)
logU=−3.07 ± 0.3 (CCC I, CCC II)
[C/α]=−0.36 ± 0.12 (CCC I, CCC II)
* Galaxies: No mention of galaxies in any of the papers.
* 3 galaxies within 500 km/s, all low mass and moderately low SFR, project sep = 120 - 130 kpc.
