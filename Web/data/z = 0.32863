Q1354+048 / z = 0.32863
---------------------------------
* From prior works:
logN(HI) = 17.48Â±0.01 (Chen et.al.+19)
d(LLS) =  126  kpc (Chen et.al.+19)
bHI=  18  km/s (Chen et.al.+19)

*Alternate name is SDSSJ 135726.27+043541.4
* Low metallicity (pristine like) gas.  
* No corresponding metal lines are seen in the COS spectra. The higher S/N HIRES data shows very narrow and unsaturated Mg II and Fe II 2600 single component profiles. No other metal lines are seen in the HIRES data as well. This absorber was reported by Chen et al. (2018) and Wotta et al. (2019) because of its low metallicity. Chen et al. claim the metallicity has to be lower than 0.3% solar, making it one of the lowest metallicity absorber near a galaxy. There is an LRG at an impact parameter of 126 kpc. Chen et al. were not conclusive on the detection of Mg II and Fe II. But the more recent Berg et al. (2019) with their new HIRES observations clearly show the Mg II and Fe II as detections, with a metallicity estimate between -2.6 and -1.9 dex. Berg et al. conclude that this absorber is therefore not "pristine", but is low metallicity (consistent with gas probably getting accreted from the IGM by the LRG). See Berg et al. (2019) Sec D for a discussion on the metallicity of this absorber.
