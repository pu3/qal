PKS0552-640  / z = 0.3451
---------------------------------
* Our inferences
- Clean pLLS with a good measurement on HI column density
- Besides weak C III and Si III, no other metal lines detected
- Absorber of low metallicity (possibly less than 1/10th solar)
- A satellite HI cloud within 200 km/s.
- We have UVES, which shows no Mg II detection, or Fe II

* From prior works:
logN(HI)=16.90±0.08(Lehner et.al.)
logU=>−3.8(Lehner et.al.)
[X/H]=<−1.5(Lehner et.al.)

* Lehner's bimodal paper and Wotta et al. 2016 (low metallicity absorbers at z < 1 paper)
* Has H I, metal column densities, metallicity.
* Metallicity < -1.6 (Wotta et al. 2016)
* Stevens, Shull et al. have HI column density for v = 0 km/s and v = +180 km/s components
* no galaxy information in previous papers
* Sowgat says 4 galaxies within 150 kpc, all low SFR
