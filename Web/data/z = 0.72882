* From prior works:
logN(HI)=16.66±0.05 (Lehner et.al.)
logN(OVI)=13.92±0.07 (Lehner et.al.)
[X/H]= <−2.00(Lehner et.al.)
logU > −3.20(Lehner et.al.)

*It's a multiphase absorber(Lehner et.al.)
* Lehner et al. Bimodal metallicity distribution paper covers this.
* Line measurements, abundances are all available.
* no galaxy reported (same as previous absorber)
* MUSE has one galaxy at 175 kpc with high SFR.
